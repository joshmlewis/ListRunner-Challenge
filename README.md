# Description
This is a barebones boilerplate for HTML and Compass.

# To Run Compass/SASS
Make sure you have Compass installed and then do `compass watch compass/`. It should say `>>> Compass is watching for changes. Press Ctrl-C to Stop`. And what you change in the compass directory will now overwrite main.css.
